REST is simple and widely used, while GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need. 
Choosing between them depends on project requirements and data structure.`,
    multiDescription: `REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods and are stateless, meaning each request contains all the information needed to process it.
